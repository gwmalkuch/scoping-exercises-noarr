		Exercise 5

		Bean counting

		(From EJS, Ch. 3 Exercises, Pg 56.)

		You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

		Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.

		Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
		 */

		function countBs(string) { //declare function countBs with parameter string
			var sum = 0; //declare local var sum
			for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { //declare for loop with variable i to count strings length
				if(string.charAt(i) === "B") { //if the value is equal to B
					sum = sum +1; //loop sum plus one
				}
			}
			return sum; //returns the final value of the count of that occurence
		}

		function countChar(string, character) { //declare function countChar with parameters string and character
			 var count = 0; //declare local var count
			 for (var j = 0; j < string.length; j++) { //declare for loop with variable j to count strings length
				 if (string.charAt(j) === character) { //if the value is equal to character
					 count = count + 1; //loop count plus one
				 }
			 }
			 return count; //return final value of count
		}

		function countBs2(string) { //declare function countBs2 with string as parameter
			return countChar(string, "B"); //returns value of string and B
		}

		// Tests
		console.log(countBs("Blah Blah Blah") === 3);
		console.log(countBs("abcde") === 0);
		console.log(countBs("ABCDE") === 1);
		console.log(countBs("") === 0);

		console.log(countChar("kayak", "k") === 2);
		console.log(countChar("kayak", "K") === 0);
		console.log(countChar("eaee", "e") === 3);
		console.log(countChar("", "a") === 0);
